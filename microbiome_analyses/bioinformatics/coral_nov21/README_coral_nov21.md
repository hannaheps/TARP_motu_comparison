# coral_nov21 bioinformatic analyses

This directory currently holds the bioinformatic analysis for coral microbiome community data from November 2021.

Some output files and rawdata are too large for housing in a github repository and are therefore kept locally.
If you need access to these files, please contact the repository owner. 

All raw sequencing data will be made available upon publication of the associated manuscript (likely the NCBI SRA)
