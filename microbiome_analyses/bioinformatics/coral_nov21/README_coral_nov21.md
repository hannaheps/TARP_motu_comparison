# coral_nov21 bioinformatic analyses

This directory currently holds the bioinformatic analysis for coral microbiome community data from November 2021.

Some output files and rawdata are too large for housing in a github repository and are therefore kept locally.
If you need access to these files, please contact the repository owner. 

Raw sequence data are available on the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession PRJNA11146751 (upon publication)
